# **Pyber Analysis**

## **Overview**

The purpose of the Pyber analysis was to create a summary dataframe to show the differences in ride sharing data by city type from the data we have been collecting as well as the dataframes we created earlier. Another request V. Isualize has also assigned me and Omar is to create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares by each city type as well. 

### **Results**

As per our research with the data provided, we have found some remarkably interesting results! 

The most obvious, and probably to no surprise, is that Urban area has the most total number of rides, with the most total number of drivers as well. However, although the number of rides is substantially greater in volume than the other two at 1,625, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest at only $16.57. Although the number of rides is high, the drivers have a lower rate of fare per ride. 

Suburban Areas, although with a thousand less number of rides, and 625 total rides (approximately 38% of the total rides Urban areas have), suburban areas have a much better ratio with their fares per ride at $39.50. The total number of drivers are also very low compared to Urban areas at 490. The suburban drivers total fares also are almost 50% of urban areas with a comparison of $19,356.33 to $39,854.38 as well. Given they have 1900 less drivers, this appears to be a great ratio for the company, the drivers!

Rural Areas have the least number of drivers and the least amount of total rides. However, their average fare per driver is $55.49 while the average fare is at $34.62. Rural areas have no where near the numbers Urban or Suburban have with less than 100 drivers in rotation and only 125 total rides. This is probably an indication of longer trips with less people in the area. 

Suburban areas appear to be the best location for drivers with a good balance of riders, drivers and average fares per driver and average fares per ride. 

We have provided a figure analysis below:

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, we find the Urban driver market to be heavily saturated and would probably recommend the CEO to focus adding drivers in the rural areas or suburban areas. If possible, we may also recommend increasing the average cost of rides so that the drivers may make more individually as well since the area is over saturated with drivers. 

The suburban area appears to be at a good balance with the average fare per ride at $30.97. With drivers making more than the average fare per ride, we may possibly increase the number of drivers slightly without effecting the average fare per driver too much. 

The rural drivers make alot more money per ride and per driver, however there are significantly less rides being sold. Increasing the drivers in the area may help gain more riders, however, will ofcourse drop the fares per driver. Although we believe we can increase the number of drivers here, it should not be by great amount. 

All in all, the line chart below does show the figures to be fairly steady for all three areas with the most flucations coming from Urban Areas:

We hope the CEO and V. Isualize like our presentation! We are now ready, willing and prepared
