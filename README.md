# **Pyber Analysis**

## **Overview**

The purpose of the Pyber analysis was to create a summary dataframe to show the differences in ride sharing data by city type from the data we have been collecting as well as the dataframes we created earlier. Another request V. Isualize has also assigned myself and Omar is to create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares by each city type as well. 

### **Results**

As per our research with the data provided, we have found some very interesting results! The most obvious, and probably to no surprise, is that Urban area has the most total number of rides, with the most total number of drivers as well. However, although the number of rides are substantially greater in volume than the other two, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is the lowest at only $16.57.
